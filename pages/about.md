My name is **Tandy Suo Tan**. I'm the co-founder and President of RnDGo Inc, a Montreal-based AI start up. I earned my PhD degree in Industrial Engineering from Concordia University, and Master's degree in Robotics from [University of Guelph. I'm a passionate software developer, and have years of hands-on experience in developing enterprise-level Content Management Systems (CMS), using a broad range of technologies: Python (Django), JavaScript (jQuery and VueJS), CSS, HTML5, MySQL, C#, AWS, etc.

At RnDGo, apart from playing a management role, I lead the dev team to develop and improve our online services. The process of from zero to one brings me tremendous pressure and pleasure. I have learnt so much that I could not even have thought of over the past years.

I created this blog to keep and share some of my thoughts and experience about programming. I will update this blog on a weekly basis.

As a full-stack developer, **Python** and **JavaScript** are now the two pillars on the tech side of me, but I still love **C#** `^_^`. In 2018, much of my spare time will be spent on learning the cutting-edge **new electricity** - **AI**, and reading book on management. I also dive into the wild when I need to be freed.

#### Life is short, I use Python!

> Beautiful is better than ugly.  
> Explicit is better than implicit.  
> Simple is better than complex.  
> Complex is better than complicated.  
> Flat is better than nested.  
> Sparse is better than dense.  
> Readability counts.  
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
> Although practicality beats purity.  
> Errors should never pass silently.  
> Unless explicitly silenced.  
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
> Now is better than never.  
> Although never is often better than _right_ now.  
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
