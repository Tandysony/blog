My name is **Suo Tan**, you can call me **Tandy** as well. I’m a Full-Stack Developer & Team Leader at RnDGo Inc - a Montreal-based AI startup. I received my Master’s degree in Robotics from the University of Guelph. I’m a passionate software developer, and have years of hands-on experience in developing enterprise-level online and offline Content Management Systems (CMS), using a broad range of technologies: Python (Django), JavaScript (jQuery and Vue.js/Node.js), CSS, HTML5, MySQL, C#, .NET and AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, SES, Route53, CloudFront, etc.), automation testing (Selenium, Jenkins), etc.

At RnDGo, I lead the dev team to develop and improve our online services. The process of from zero to one brings me tremendous pressure and pleasure. I have learned so much that I could not even have thought of over the past years.

I created this blog to keep and share some of my thoughts and experience about programming. I will update this blog on a weekly basis.

As a full-stack developer, **Python** and **JavaScript** are now the two pillars on the tech side of me, but I still love **C#**, ^\_^. In 2018, much of my spare time will be spent on learning the cutting-edge **new electricity - AI**, and reading books on management. I also dive into the wild when I need to be freed.

#### Life is short, I use Python!

> Beautiful is better than ugly.  
> Explicit is better than implicit.  
> Simple is better than complex.  
> Complex is better than complicated.  
> Flat is better than nested.  
> Sparse is better than dense.  
> Readability counts.  
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
> Although practicality beats purity.  
> Errors should never pass silently.  
> Unless explicitly silenced.  
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
> Now is better than never.  
> Although never is often better than _right_ now.  
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
