The [RnDGo website](https://www.rndgo.com/) is an online platform for (academic) researchers to monitor, track, schedule and manage their highly diversified and open-ended R&D projects projects, teams and research workflows. Now it is opened for registration and free to use. However, only invited users or registered users who have their university email verified could be able to use some advanced features like paper review, task/project workflows. Go and register, create a feedback task to earn _Research Coins_ for future use.

I lead the dev team to develop the platform and services using the following technologies: Django/Python, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3, jQuery, AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, SES, Route53, etc.), MySQL and NLP (Natural Language Process). Now we are refactoring our webpage experience with RESTful APIs and Vue.js.
