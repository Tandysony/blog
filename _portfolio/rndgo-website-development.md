The RnDGo Webapp is an online platform for (academic) researchers to monitor, track, schedule and manage their highly diversified tasks, projects, teams and research workflows. It is now in private beta, only invited users are allowed to register.

I lead the dev team to develop the platform and services using the following technologies: Django/Python, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3, jQuery, AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, SES, Route53, etc.), MySQL and NLP (Natural Language Process). Now we are refactoring our webpage experience with RESTful APIs and VueJS.

I will update this page later with more screenshots once opened to public registration.
