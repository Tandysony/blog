title: A Summary of PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code
tags: [Python, PEP8]
---

As our dev team grows, I have found that our coding style is a mess (myself included), when doing code review and refactoring. Especially for someone who is new to Python and has no professional dev experience before. I have written a short summary of [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP 257: Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for them to follow. More importantly, everyone must have their code gone through a **Code Inspection** tool, e.g., the `PEP8` package (`pip install pep8`), `pylint`, or the **Inspect Code** function in PyCharm IDE, before creating a pull request.

The following are some of them:

### Indentation, line-length & code wrapping

- Always use 4 spaces for indentation (don’t use tabs)
- Write in ASCII in Python 2 and UTF-8 in Python 3
- Max line-length: 80 characters (especially in comments)
- Always indent wrapped code for readability

```python
# Good:
result = some_function_that_takes_arguments(
    'argument one,
    'argument two',
    'argument three'
)

long_foo_dict_with_many_elements = {
    'foo': 'cat',
    'bar': 'dog'
}

with open('/path/to/some/file/you/want/to/read') as file_1, \
     open('/path/to/some/file/being/written', 'w') as file_2:
    file_2.write(file_1.read())

income = (gross_wages
          + taxable_interest
          + (dividends - qualified_dividends)
          - ira_deduction
          - student_loan_interest)

# Bad:
result = some_function_that_takes_arguments(
'argument one,
'argument two', 'argument three')
result2 = some_function_that_takes_arguments('argument one', 'argument two', 'argument three')
```

### Imports

- Don’t use wildcards
- Import standard libs first, 3rd-party libs next, and local stuff last
- Try to import in a alphabetical order
- Try to use absolute imports over relative ones
- When using relative imports, be explicit (with `.`)
- Don’t import multiple packages per line

```python
# Good:
import os # STD lib imports first
import sys # alphabetical

from mypkg.sibling import example # 3rd party stuff next
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE # Acceptable

from .sibling import example # local stuff last

# Bad:
import os, sys # multiple packages
import sibling # local module without "."
from mypkg import * # wildcards
```

### Whitespace and newlines

- 2 blank lines before top-level function and class definitions
- 1 blank line before class method definitions
- Use blank lines in functions sparingly
- Avoid extraneous whitespace
- Don’t use whitespace to line up assignment operators (`=`, `:`)
- Spaces around `=` for assignment
- No spaces around `=` for default parameter values
- Spaces around mathematical operators, but group them sensibly
- Multiple statements on the same line are discouraged

```python
# Good:
spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})

if x == 4:
    print x, y
    x, y = y, x
dict['key'] = list[index]

y = 2
long_variable = 3
hypot2 = x*x + y*y
c = (a+b) * (a-b)

def complex(real, imag=0.0):
    return magic(r=real, i=imag)

do_one()
do_two()

# Bad
spam ( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } ) # spaces inside brackets
if x == 4 : print x , y ; x , y = y , x # inline statements, space before commas
dict ['key'] = list [index] # space before dictionary key
y             = 2 # Using spaces to line up assignment operators
long_variable = 3
hypot2 = x * x + y * y # Too much space around operators
c = (a + b) * (a - b) # Too much space around operators

def complex(real, imag = 0.0):
    return magic(r = real, i = imag) # Spaces in default values
```

### Comments

- Keep comments up to date - incorrect comments are worse than no comments
- Write in whole sentences
- Try to write in plain and easy-to-follow English
- Use inline comments sparingly & avoid obvious comments
- Each line of block comments should start with `#`
- Paragraphs in block comments should be separated by a line with a single `#`
- All public functions, classes and methods should have docstrings
- Docstrings should start and end with `"""`
- Docstring one-liners can be all on the same line
- In docstrings, list each argument on a separate line
- Docstrings should have a blank line before the final `"""`

```python
def my_function():
    """ A one-line docstring """

def my_other_function(parameter=False):
    """
    A multiline docstring.

    Keyword arguments:
    parameter -- an example parameter (default False)

    """
```

### Naming conventions

- Class names in **CapWords**
- Method, function and variables names in `lowercase_with_underscores`
- Private methods and properties start with `__double_underscore`
- “Protected” methods and properties start with `_single_underscore`
- If you need to use a reserved word, add a `_` to the end (e.g. `class_`)
- Use all-uppercase `FIXED_TERM` for constant variables
- Always use `self` for the first argument to instance methods
- Always use `cls` for the first argument to class methods
- Never declare functions using lambda (`f = lambda x: 2*x`)

```python
A_CONSTANT = 'ugh.'

class MyClass:
    """ A purely illustrative class """

    __property = None

    def __init__(self, property_value):
        self.__property = property_value

    def get_property(self):
        """ A simple getter for "property" """

        return self.__property

    @classmethod
    def default(cls):
        instance = MyClass("default value")
        return instance
```

The styles above are the critical ones for a clean and styled code. As always, some extra rules can be defined to suit your needs.
