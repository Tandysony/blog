I have recently found that in our team, both

```python
if request.POST:
    pass
```

and

```python
 if request.method == ‘POST’:
    pass
```

have been used to check a `POST` request. Are they the same? Which one is better? I have googled around and find out that **they are different**!

- `request.method` returns a **string** of the method used with the request, and nothing else. This is important because you can use HTTP verbs without sending data.

- If you do a boolean check as `request.POST`, it checks to _make sure that there is data in the POST QueryDict dictionary_. **If there is data then it was a POST; if no data then it evaluates as false as if no POST happened**.

Thus, `request.method == ‘POST’` is recommended as we are expecting data from a POST request.
